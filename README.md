# Branching Policies

I am [Òscar Tarrés](https://github.com/oscarta3), student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year's subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ramon Santamaria](https://github.com/raysan5).

This research project is about Branching Policies.

## Concept

Branch policies help teams protect their important branches of development, organize, solve problems in simpler ways and to work in parallel. They allow us to isolate work in progress from the already completed work in our master branch, guarantee changes before they get to master and limit who can contribute to specific branches.



To see the utility and all the advantages of Branching Policies, we will see two different ways of working. First of all we will check the Trunk-Based Development, a light branch policy, and then we will see the Feature Branching Development, used by most companies in the industry.

## Trunk-based Development

On this branching model all the developers work and collaborate on code in a single branch called ‘trunk’ or ‘master’ and then there is a separate branch for the releases. It resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques. In this case if someone checks-in wrong code everyone has to wait for it to get fixed in order to continue working on the other parts. This model has been outdated by the Feature Branching Development.
